# K-mean-clustering
K-means clustering is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm that partitions data into K distinct clusters based on feature similarity. It iteratively assigns points to the nearest cluster centroid and updates centroids to minimize within-cluster variance. It's used in pattern recognition, image analysis, and data mining.
